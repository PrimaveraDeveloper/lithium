# Primavera.Hydrogen.DesignTime.Specs

**Class library that contains types that define specifications used in the Lithium Framework.**

## Service Specification (`ServiceSpec`)

`ServiceSpec` allows describing a microservice and serializing that specification to JSON.

It includes the following information about a microservice:

- `ApiVersions`: a list indicating the versions supported by the microservice Web API.
- `AppSettings`: a list containing the applications settings used by the microservice.
- `BackgroundServices`: a list describing the background services contained in the microservice.
- `Dependencies`: a list containing the service dependencies (e.g. distributed cache, table storage, etc.).
- `Description`: contains the service description (including the identifier, the name, display name, etc.).
- `Endpoints`: describes the microservice endpoints (routes).
- `Features`: describes the features supported by the microservice.

### Serialization

To serialize a ServiceSpec:

```csharp
ServiceSpec spec = new ServiceSpec()
{
    // (...)
};

string json = spec.ToJson();
```

To deserialize:

```csharp
ServiceSpec spec1 = ServiceSpec.FromJson(new string[] { json1 });
ServiceSpec spec2 = ServiceSpec.FromJsonFile(new string[] { file1 });
```

> A microservice specification can be contained in multiple JSON files (to allow for part of the specification to be automatically generated and other parts to be specified by developers).

## Application Settings Specification (`AppSettingsSpec`)

`AppSettingsSpec` allows serializing a set of application settings for a microservice.

It is used by `ServiceSpec` but it is also used by the Lithium SDK code generation text templates to produce the application settings files (e.g. `appsettings.json`).

## Authorization Specification (`AuthorizationSpec`)

`AuthorizationSpec` allows describing the authorization resources (scopes, clients, etc.) required by a microservice (or any other application.)

It includes the following information about a microservice:

- `ApiResource`: describes the API resource for the Web API.
- `ApiScopes`: describes the API scopes required by the Web API.
- `AuthorizationPolicies`: a list containing the authorization policies defined.
- `Clients`: describes the clients that should exist to access the Web API.
