# PRIMAVERA Lithium Documentation

Welcome to the the **Lithium Framework documentation** project.

Here you will find all the information required to develop microservices with the Lithium SDK and the Lithium Modeling Framework for Visual Studio 2019.

This documentation includes information about the vision and architectural principles of PRIMAVERA Lithium, reference information about the Lithium SDK and the Lithium packages, how-to guides and a directory of the microservices available to be reused in your applications.

It is a work in progress.

## Documentation Structure

This project is structured in a way that reflects the different kinds of documentation available.

Currently it contains the following chapters:

- [**vision**](./vision/README.md) - the vision behind Lithium and the general principles and technologies that drive its development.
- [**howto**](./howto/README.md) - how to guides to help development with the Lithium Framework.
- [**samples**](./samples/README.md) - samples to jump start the development with the Lithium Framework.
- [**training**](./training/README.md) - training material about the Lithium Framework.
- [**dir**](./dir/README.md) - a directory of all the microservices currently available.
- [**ref**](./ref/README.md) - reference documentation for all the framework components, including the SDK, Hydrogen, and other packages.

## Jump Start

If you wish to start developing a microservice while going through the documentation, start with the [howto](./howto/README.md) and [samples](./samples/README.md) sections. You will need to [setup your machine](./howto/howto-setup-devopment-environment.md) before using the Lithium SDK.

To model your microservice, check the [Service Designer](./ref/sdk-2.0/service-designer.md) reference.

## Major Releases

The current version of the Lithium Framework is **version 2.0**.

### Lithium 2.0

This is a major upgrade of the framework to support .NET Core 3.0 and Visual Studio 2019.

Given the changes in .NET Core, this release includes various changes in the code generated for microservices and in the Hydrogen libraries. It also includes a small set of new features in the modeling framework.

### Lithium 1.0

This was the first release of the framework that evolved for almost 2 years since 2018. It supported the development of microservices on .NET Core 2.0 and Visual Studio 2017.

## Contributing and Feedback

Contribution is limited, for the time being, to the Lithium development team.

Any problem found in the documentation or any other suggestion should be reported in the Issues section.
