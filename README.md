# PRIMAVERA Lithium Documentation

Welcome to the the **Lithium Framework documentation**.

Here you will find all the information required to develop microservices with the Lithium SDK and the Lithium Modeling Framework for Visual Studio 2019.

This documentation includes information about the vision and architectural principles of PRIMAVERA Lithium, reference information about the Lithium SDK and the Lithium packages, how-to guides and a directory of the microservices available to be reused in your applications.

It is a work in progress.

## Documentation Structure

This project is structured in a way that reflects the different kinds of documentation available.

The following chapters are available:

- [**vision**](./vision/README.md) - the vision behind Lithium and the general principles and technologies that drive its development.
- [**capabilities**](./capabilities/README.md) - reference documentation about the Lithium Framework capabilities.
- [**how to**](./howto/README.md) - how to guides to accelerate development with the Lithium Framework.
- [**samples**](./samples/README.md) - samples that illustrate features of the Lithium Framework.
- [**training**](./training/README.md) - training material about the Lithium Framework.
- [**reference**](./ref/README.md) - reference documentation for all the framework components (SDK, Hydrogen, etc.).
- [**directory**](./dir/README.md) - a directory of all the Lithium microservices currently available.

## Jump Start

If you wish to go through the documentation before developing your microservice, start with the [how to](./howto/README.md) and [samples](./samples/README.md) sections.

> You will need to [setup your machine](./howto/howto-setup-devopment-environment.md) before using the Lithium SDK.

To start designing your microservice, check the [Service Designer](./ref/sdk-2.0/service-designer.md) reference to understand how a microservice is modeled with the Lithium SDK.

## Major Releases

The current version of the Lithium Framework is **version 2.0**.

### Lithium 2.0

This is a major upgrade of the framework to support .NET Core 3.1 and Visual Studio 2019.

Given the changes in .NET Core, this release includes various changes in the code generated for microservices and in the Hydrogen libraries. It also includes a small set of new features in the modeling framework.

### Lithium 1.0

This was the first release of the framework that evolved for almost 2 years since 2018. It supported the development of microservices on .NET Core 2.0 and Visual Studio 2017.

## Release Notes

- [Lithium SDK](./ref/sdk-2.0/release-notes.md)
- [Hydrogen](./ref/hydrogen-2.0/release-notes.md)
- [Hydrogen DesignTime](./ref/hydrogen-designtime-2.0/release-notes.md)
