# PRIMAVERA Lithium Documentation

Welcome to the the Lithium Framework documentation project.

Here you will find all the information required to develop microservices with the Lithium SDK and the Lithium Modeling Framework for Visual Studio 2019.

This documentation includes information about the vision and architectural principles of PRIMAVERA Lithium, reference information about the Lithium SDK and the Lithium packages, how-to guides and a directory of the microservices available to be reused in your applications.

It is a work in progress.

## Project Structure

Currently it contains the following chapters:

- [**vision**](./vision/README.md): the vision behind Lithium and the general principles and technologies that drive its development.
- [**howto**](./howto/README.md): how to guides and samples to help development with the Lithium Framework.
- [**dir**](./dir/README.md): a directory of all the microservices currently available.
- [**ref**](./ref/README.md): reference documentation for all the framework components, from the SDK to the most basic packages.
