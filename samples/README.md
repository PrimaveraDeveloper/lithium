# Samples

This chapter includes samples to jump start the development of microservices using the Lithium Framework.

## Sample Projects

The following sample projects are available to illustrate features of the framework.

| Sample | Description
| - | - |
| [HelloWorld](./_assets/HelloWorld.zip) | The very basic Hello World microservice implementation |
| [EventBusPublisher](./_assets/EventBusPublisher.zip) | A microservice that publishes one event to the Event Bus |
| [EventBusSubscriber](./_assets/EventBusSubscriber.zip) | A microservice that subscribes one event from the Event Bus (published by EventBusPublisher) |

> When opening these solutions with the latest version of the SDK, you may be required to upgrade the solution and update dependencies on packages. After doing that, reopen the solution, transform all text templates and, only then, run the sample.

## Sample Code

The following code samples illustrate how some features should be implemented on microservices.
