# Capability - User Interface

> Tags: MVC, Angular, Home Page, Controllers, Views

Although, by default, a Web API does not include user interface, Lithium microservices include a very simple [home page](home-page.md) built with ASP.NET Core.

There will be scenarios where you will want to implement some kind of user interface for the users. Although the support in the Lithium Framework is limited (and will always be) to plumbing, it is possible to achieve that by customization.

The following How To articles illustrate it:
