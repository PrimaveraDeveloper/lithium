- [Console Applications](./console-applications.md)
- [Data Protection](./data-protection.md)
- Database (see [Storage](./storage.md))
- [Documentation (Client libraries)](./doc-client-lib.md)
- [Documentation (Web API)](./doc-web-api.md)
- [Email](./email.md)
- [Environments]

These capabilities are provided in different forms:

- Transparently, as part of the code automatically generated for services created with the Framework.
- As modeling artifacts (e.g. dependencies) that can be used in the service's models.
- As library components (e.g. Hydrogen) that can be referenced in service projects.
- Etc.

> The list above may be incomplete. Be sure to also search this repository using keywords associated with the capability you are looking for, before assuming that the Framework does not support it. If, after that, you are not sure but you believe that the Framework should support a particular feature, please contact the Lithium development team (use the Issues section).
