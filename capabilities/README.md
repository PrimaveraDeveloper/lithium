# Capabilities

This chapter includes reference documentation about the capabilities supported by the Lithium Framework and the microservices developed with it.

This the list of all the capabilities (order alphabetically):

- Access Tokens (see [Authorization](./authorization.md))
- [Authentication](./authentication.md)
- [Authorization](./authorization.md)
- [Background Services](./xxx.md)
- Blobs (see [Storage](./storage.md))
- [Caching](./xxx.md)
- [Client Libraries](./xxx.md)
- [Configuration](./xxx.md)
- [Console Applications](./xxx.md)
- [Data Protection](./xxx.md)
- Database (see [Storage](./storage.md))
- [Documentation (Web API)](./xxx.md)
- [Documentation (Client libraries)](./xxx.md)
- [Email](./xxx.md)
- [Environments](./xxx.md)
- [Error Handling](./xxx.md)
- [Event-driven](./xxx.md)
- Files (see [Storage](./storage.md))
- [Home Page](./xxx.md)
- [HTTPS](./xxx.md)
- Identity Server (see [Authorization](./authorization.md))
- [Localization](./xxx.md)
- [Logging, Tracing and Telemetry](./xxx.md)
- [Monitoring and Health Checks](./xxx.md)
- [MVC](./xxx.md)
- OAuth (see [Authentication](./authentication.md))
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) (see [Authentication](./authentication.md))
- [Passwords](./xxx.md)
- [Phone Numbers](./xxx.md)
- [Pipelines](./xxx.md)
- [reCAPTCHA](./xxx.md)
- REST (see [Web API](./web-api.md))
- [Search](./xxx.md)
- [Secrets](./xxx.md)
- [Serialization (JSON)](./xxx.md)
- [SMS](./xxx.md)
- [Storage](./storage.md)
- Tables (see [Storage](./storage.md))
- [Text Composition](./xxx.md)
- [User-agent Parsing and Device Detection](./xxx.md)
- [User Interface](./xxx.md)
- [Validation](./xxx.md)
- [Versioning](./xxx.md)
- [Versioning (Web API)](./xxx.md)
- [WCF](./xxx.md)
- [Web API](./web-api.md)

These capabilities are provided in different forms to be used in microservices:

- Transparently, as part of the code automatically generated for services created with the Framework.
- As modeling artifacts (e.g. dependencies) that can be used in the service models.
- As library components (e.g. Hydrogen) that can be referenced in service projects.
- Etc.

> The list above may be incomplete. Be sure to also search this repository using keywords associated with the capability you are looking for, before assuming that the Framework does not support it. If, after that, you are not sure but you believe that the Framework should support a particular feature, please contact the Lithium development team (use the Issues section on this repository).
