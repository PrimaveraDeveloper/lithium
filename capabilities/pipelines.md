# Capability - Pipelines

> Tags: Handler

You can use the pipeline design pattern easily using the Lithium Framework. This design pattern is very powerful to easily implement, for example, multi-level caching.

Hydrogen includes a library that provides a configurable and extensible implementation in [Primavera.Hydrogen.Pipelines](../ref/hydrogen-2.0/Pipelines.md).

Various services use this component. [Settings Service](../dir/common/ss.md) is one example.
