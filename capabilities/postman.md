# Capability - Postman

> Tags: Testing, Web API

You can test the microservice Web API endpoints using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The artifacts generated for a microservice include a Postman collection for that purpose. This collection is generated in the `DesignTime\GeneratedCode\Postman.gen.postman_collection.json` file.
