# Capability - Background Services

> Tags: Background Service, Background Worker

Background services allow the microservice host application to run work in the background, leveraging the .NET Core concept of hosted services.

Typically these services are used to perform asynchronous initialization of the microservice host application in the background or to execute repeating and/or long running operations that react to specific events (or queues).
