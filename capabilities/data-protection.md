# Capability - Data Protection

> Tags: Encryption, Blob Storage

When you need to store and/or manipulate security-sensitive data in a microservice, you should use the built-in data protection dependency.

For more information about how this mechanism works see [ASP.NET Core Data Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection).

To add it a microservice simply add the "Data Protection" dependency and configure the respective options.
