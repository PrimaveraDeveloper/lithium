# Capability - Versioning

> Tags: Compatibility

Versioning is very important for any application. It is particularly important for microservices.

All microservices should be explicitly versioned, considering that any breaking change to the Web API, should result in a new version and decisions on how the previous versions should be supported.

This is a area of the Modeling Framework that is not yet completely developed/matured. Nevertheless, the service model supports defining the current service version and specifying additional API versions (fully retro-compatible).
