# Capability - WCF

> Tags: XML, SOAP

You can also invoke SOAP APIs using WCF with the Lithium Framework, which is useful when integrating microservices with external APIs.

Hydrogen includes a library that supports it: [Primavera.Hydrogen.Wcf.Client](../ref/hydrogen-2.0/Wcf.Client.md).

The [Data Lookup Service](../dir/common/README.md) is one example of a service that uses this component.
