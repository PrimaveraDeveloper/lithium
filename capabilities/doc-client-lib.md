# Capability - Documentation (Client Library)

> Tags: Markdown

When the microservice solution includes the client library project, the client library documentation will be generated automatically.

This documentation is produced as a markdown file (`GeneratedCode\ClientLibDoc.gen.md`) in the `ClientLib` project.

It will also be available as HTML from the microservice [home page](./home-page.md).
