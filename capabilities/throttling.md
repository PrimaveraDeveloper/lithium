# Capability - Throttling

> Tags: API, REST

Depending on the behavior of the Web API of a microservice it might be necessary to implement a throttling mechanism to prevent clients from performing too may requests in any given period of time.

Hydrogen includes components to setup such a mechanism, based on client rate limiting. See [Primavera.Hydrogen.AspNetCore.Throttling](../ref/hydrogen-2.0/AspNetCore.Throttling.md).
