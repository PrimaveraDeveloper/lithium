# Capability - Home Page

> Tags: MVC, Monitoring

All microservices include a home page - available in the service's base address - that presents basic information about it:

![Microservice Home Page](../howto/_assets/homepage.png "Microservice Home Page")

This home page has basically three purposes:

- It allows verifying application startup (if it responds it means the service web application startup has no problems).
- It allows verifying the version of the microservice running.
- It provides links to the service's client library and Web API documentation.
