> Tags: Texting, Twilio, Notifications

As a norm, the [Notifications Service](../dir/common/README.md) should be used to send SMS notifications.

Hydrogen also includes a component called [ITextMessagingService](../ref/hydrogen-2.0/TextMessaging.Abstractions.md) that allows sending SMS messages using the Twilio API.
